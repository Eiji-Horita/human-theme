# Theme

Work in progress. Screenshots available soon. Debian package available soon.

## About

This is an adaptation of [Clearlooks-Ph√©nix](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix) theme, a GTK 3 port of old GTK 2 / GNOME 2 [Clearlooks style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearlooks). This is also a continuation of [Human Quarny](https://www.mate-look.org/p/1013593/) theme.

This theme works with GTK 2.24+ (*gtk2-engines-murrine* is required) and GTK 3.24+, it is tested and developped with *Mate 1.24.0* and *GTK 3.24.14* under *Debian Testing*.
