# The old Ubuntu Human theme

Work in progress.

## About

This is an adaptation of [Clearlooks-Ph√©nix](https://github.com/jpfleury/clearlooks-phenix) theme, a GTK 3 port of old GTK 2 / GNOME 2 [Clearlooks style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearlooks). This is also a continuation of [Human Quarny](https://www.mate-look.org/p/1013593/) theme.

This theme works with GTK 2.24+ (*gtk2-engines-murrine* is required) and GTK 3.24+, it is tested and developped with *Mate 1.24.0* and *GTK 3.24.18* under *Debian Testing*.

Run [a widget factory 2](https://github.com/luigifab/awf) with screenshot on theme reload:
```
awf-gtk2 -s ~/2.png
awf-gtk3 -s ~/3.png
```

Run [entr](https://github.com/clibs/entr) to send sighup signal to auto reload theme:
```
ls ~/.themes/old-human-theme/gtk-3.0/*.css | entr killall -s SIGHUP awf-gtk2
ls ~/.themes/old-human-theme/gtk-3.0/*.css | entr killall -s SIGHUP awf-gtk3
```

Run [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to generate the diff image:
```
compare -fuzz 1% -compose src -highlight-color blue -lowlight-color none ~/2.png ~/3.png ~/diff.png
composite ~/diff.png ~/2.png ~/diff.png
eom ~/diff.png
```

You can also run entr to auto generate the diff image:
