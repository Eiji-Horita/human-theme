Overview
--------

Original `Clearlooks-Phénix project`_ by `Jean-Philippe Fleury`_ is a GTK3 port
of old GTK2/GNOME2 `Clearlooks style`_.

This project is an adaptation of that to look like old Ubuntu "Human Clearlooks"
style, and GTK2 variant of `Human Quarny theme`_ in particular.

Work in progress, not ready for general use yet.
